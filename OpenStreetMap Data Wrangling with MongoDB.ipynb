The data reviewed was fairly clean, but there appears to be a number of small anomalies (e.g. 'CO' being entered as a postcode, Unicode characters being added to fields). While looking at a small set of data these problems are easily identified, as the dataset reviewed grows manual corrections and small cleaning routines are not able to keep up with the lack of consistency.
